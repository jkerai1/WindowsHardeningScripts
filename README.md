# Windows Hardening  

Hardening Powershell /cmd  Scripts to deploy from something like intune or even Live response library!  

These scripts are ideal for deploying for sandboxes to test recommendations  

Caution: Some scripts may brick your environment, review carefully 

Requires admin as registry changes 

Scripts are not signed 

Write-Host is not applicable in intune scenario  


May need to comment in/out the "New-Item" if the key does not exist/Does already exist

Some of this would be better done with GPO/Intune but if not applicable can use powershell script

Could even be deployed from Live Response (MDE) if unsigned powershell scripts are allowed as post compromise remediation  

Pull Requests Welcome
